# Logic
Logic gates were used to build a bit adder in C++, Prolog and Scheme

The goal of this program was to build logic gates in three languages (Scheme, C++ and prolog) and to use those logical gates to then build a bit adder. 

Each program will call a function and pass in values to evaluate and return the new value plus the carry bit.
